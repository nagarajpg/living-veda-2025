  <p>One of the most luminous manifestations of the Spirit that humanity has received is enshrined in what we know as the Vedas. Yet, paradoxically, the Vedas remain among the least understood—not only in the world at large, but even here, in the sacred land of their origin. While the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Srimad Bhagavatam are celebrated and cherished, the Vedas themselves often remain in the shadows. The time has now come to bring them forth again in a living, transformative way.</p>

    <p><strong>At the root of Hindu civilization lies the Veda</strong> — the fountain of our philosophies, the bedrock of our religions, the kernel of our thought, the key to our ethics and society, the summary of our culture, and the rivet of our nationality. Concealed in this small body of inspired speech is the soul of India's destiny. — <em>Sri Aurobindo's vision</em></p>
  </div>

  <p>This conference is a step toward redressing a great lacuna in India's and humanity's self-understanding—by bringing the study of the Veda to the forefront as a pressing imperative of our times. Its central aim is to inquire into the contemporary relevance of the Veda: what light it can shed on sustainability, integral education, good governance, human unity, and above all, spiritual transformation.</p>

  <p>The Veda is not a relic of ritualism nor a mere text of archaic hymns. It is living revelation, mantra, a fusion of knowledge, word, and work. The Western lens, shaped largely by Sāyaṇa's ritualistic commentary and given prominence by Max Müller and others, saw only the outer form. For them, Sāyaṇa stood as the traditional authority, although he lived only in the fourteenth century A.D., and far earlier there were other and more trustworthy commentators—Yāska, Kātyāyana, Durgācārya, Ānanda Tīrtha, Bhāskara, and Raghavendra Tīrtha etc. Sri Aurobindo was the first in modern times to declare with luminous certainty that the Veda contains a deeper, hidden meaning—perceived not by scholarly ingenuity but by the inner vision of the ṛṣis. For him, the hymns were not intellectual compositions but mantra-dṛṣṭayaḥ—direct, inspired perceptions of Truth.</p>

  <p>Following Sri Aurobindo's trail, Sri T V Kapali Sastry and later Dr. R.L. Kashyap carried this work forward—bringing out translations and interpretations that revealed the Veda as a treasury of spiritual knowledge, mystical symbolism, and eternal guidance. Thanks to their efforts, the 20th century prepared the ground for the 21st century to restore the Veda to its original stature and role after millennia of neglect.</p>

    <p>The concern of this conference is not whether the Veda will be enthroned as the supreme Hindu scripture, but rather: what is the meaning of the Veda? What is the secret it conceals? How is that secret still relevant to our lives, our societies, our collective future? In this quest, Sri Aurobindo's <em>The Secret of the Veda</em> offers a luminous starting point.</p>

    <p><strong>Sri Aurobindo firmly believed</strong> that the rediscovery and rejuvenation of India's spiritual knowledge and practice should be the central work of the Indian Renaissance.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Using <em>The Secret of the Veda</em> as its basis, this conference seeks to explore the vast possibilities connected with the application of Veda Knowledge, engaging in the enhancement of human potentiality and the deeper transformation of life.</p>
